# My Tiny Game Project

## 2025/03/29 Log Entry

Ahh, the start of a brand new project. The best feeling in the world üî•. Most projects never reach production‚Äîyou get stuck, get busy with other things, or simply lose interest. Maybe you leave it for a month, only to return to a project you once knew like the back of your hand‚Äîonly to find that the code now makes less sense than a screen door on a submarine.

However, inevitably, as one project falls into oblivion, another is born. The latest, the shiniest, the new project.

Maybe it's to hold myself accountable that I had the idea to start a devlog related to this project. My aim is to write an entry with every update‚Äîdocumenting the latest changes, the overall state of things, the process, and maybe even my own thoughts, struggles, and breakthroughs. Perhaps this approach will keep me **from abandoning** the project, like so many others in the past ü§û. Here's hoping!

This first push is close to a clean slate. I had the thought of creating a game‚Äînothing too complex. I envisioned a simple 2D isometric adventure game, blending the classic feel of old Zelda with an upgrade system and room progression reminiscent of _The Binding of Isaac_. When written out, it does sound pretty ambitious. I guess I'd like to get to a point where I at least have a working demo or concept.

Right now, though, I have an isometric square where a yellow ball can move around. Not much, but it's a start.

Here's to hoping it'll be more ‚úåÔ∏è
